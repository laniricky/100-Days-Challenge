## How to Use This Repository 🛠️

Each day has its own folder inside the **projects** directory, containing:
- Project files for the day.
- A README file for each day's projects, explaining what was built and how to run it.

### Running the Projects:

#### Python Projects:
```bash
cd path/to/your/100-days-of-coding/projects/day_X
python3 file_name.py

#### Flask Web Apps:
```bash
cd path/to/your/100-days-of-coding/projects/day_X
python3 app.py

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

#### HTML/JavaScript Projects:
```bash
Open the `.html` file in your browser to view the project.

#### Ruby Projects:
```bash
cd path/to/your/100-days-of-coding/projects/day_X
ruby file_name.rb
