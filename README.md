# 100 Days of Coding Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! The goal of this challenge is to learn software engineering by building simple projects across various programming languages and frameworks while pushing them to GitHub. Each day will be filled with coding, creativity, and a sprinkle of fun! 

## Challenge Overview 📝
- **Duration:** 100 Days
- **Start Date:** October 9, 2024
