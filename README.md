## How to Use This Repository 🛠️

Each day has its own folder inside the **projects** directory, containing:
- Project files for the day.
- A README file for each day's projects, explaining what was built and how to run it.

### Running the Projects:

#### Python Projects:
1. Navigate to the directory of the Python project:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/100-days-of-coding/projects/day_X

2. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python3 file_name.py

#### JavaScript/HTML Projects:
1. Open the `.html` file in your browser directly by double-clicking it or running:
   ```bash
   open file_name.html

#### Flask Projects:
1. Ensure Flask is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install flask

2. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py

3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to view the app.

#### Ruby Projects:
1. Navigate to the Ruby project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/100-days-of-coding/projects/day_X

2. Run the Ruby file:
   ```bash
   ruby file_name.rb

#### C++ Projects:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/100-days-of-coding/projects/day_X

2. Compile the C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name

3. Run the compiled file:
   ```bash
   ./file_name

#### PHP Projects:
1. Place the PHP files in your web server’s root directory (e.g., `/var/www/html`).

2. Start the PHP server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000

3. Open `http://localhost:8000/file_name.php` in the browser.
